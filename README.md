# Horiseon Refactor

## Description 
Assignment for UCB Week one challenge. Challenge required Refactor of the Horiseon index and css styles. Includes new alt tags for images, restructuring of index.html, search engine optimization, and combining css rules. I first started with restructuring the semantic elements of the webpage and getting my index looking concise. After some resarch on SEOs and semantic elements to use, I decided using <main> and having <aside> in my main element was the best plan of action to keep the structure okay. Next I transfered over to my style sheet to group all of my utilitys together and redo classes etc. I had a hard time finding a way to simplify the main body without messing up the right float of the <aside>. Lastly I went back through my html giving everything a final check and adding my alt tags!
